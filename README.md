# python-deriv-api
A python implementation of deriv api library

### Requirement
Python (3.9.6 or higher is recommended) and pip3

# Installation



# Usage
This is basic deriv-api python library which helps to make websocket connection and
deal the API calls (including subscription).

Import the module

```
from deriv_api import deriv_api
```

Access 

```
api = deriv_api.DerivAPI({ endpoint: 'ws://...', app_id: 1234 });
response = await api.ping({'ping': 1})
print(response) 
```

## Creating a websocket connection
- Pass the arguments needed to create a connection:
```
   api = deriv_api.DerivAPI({ endpoint: 'ws://...', app_id: 1234 });
```

- create and use a previously opened connection:
```
   connection = await websockets.connect('ws://...')
   api = deriv_api.DerivAPI(connection=connection)
```
